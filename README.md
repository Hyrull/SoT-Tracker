# SoT Tracker

SoT Tracker is a companion web app for **Sea of Thieves** that makes browsing your commendations fast, organized, and convenient. This tool provides filtering, search, and says what each commendation unlocks. I made it for myself at first because I couldn't be bothered to browse through the convoluted in-game menus all the time (and move through in-game shops to figure out what it unlocks), but figured why not make it available for others.
> No external script needed. A single click on the "refresh" button makes it easy. See "How it does it" below.

## How it does it

1. Create an account on SoT Tracker.
2. Import your **"rat" token** from the Sea of Thieves website. This gives the tracker **read-only access** to your progress (commendations, levels, monthly ledger unlocks).  
   - The RAT is stored encrypted.
   - Your data is never stored permanently — deleting your account removes all traces.
3. The website automatically updates your data when you click the **refresh** button.

> Using the "rat" token simplifies the workflow compared to manual importers: no extra steps or scripts are needed, just refresh and go. However it dies every week or so and might need updating. Can't help it.
