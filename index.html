        I originally built it for myself as a way to have all my commendations be displayed on a single page, ordered, organized, with filter and search options, 
        and displaying what each of them unlocks. Since the game couldn't provide half these features, I made them myself.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>Why bother, when in-game menus exists?</h2><p>Again, the in-game menus doesn't have filtering, search bars, and doesn't say what they unlock. And I wanted a tool that's quick, responsive and easy to use while you're in-game.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>How does it even work?</h2><p>You create an account on this website, and then import your Rare Authentification Token (RAT) from the Sea of Thieves website - gives our website a temporary
        read-only access to your game progress (levels, commendations, monthly ledger unlocks). No data of yours is kept in the databases, would you delete your SoT Tracker account.
        Your RAT is stored crypted in the database. Everything is open-source, so if you can read code, you'll find the GitHub repos below.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>What's this score/number I can see when I'm logged in?</h2><p>Your account score. Each grade of each commendation awards a number of points, all of which adds up to form your total score. The higher the better! You can hover any commendation (or tap, on mobile) to see how many points it gives, in the top-left corner.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>Does this website work on mobile? / Is an app planned?</h2><p>The website does work on mobile. You can get the website as an 'app' by opening it via Google Chrome, pressing the three dots in the top-right corner and selecting 'Add to Home Screen'.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>What does it look like?</h2><p>See a couple screenshots on the carousel above or try browsing the <a data-itemprop="url" href="/commendations" data-discover="true">Commendations</a> page - even without making an account, you can browse a demo page with my own commendations from late November, 2025.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>Why use the "rat" token and not an importer like other fan websites?</h2><p>This website was originally built to meet my own needs - as a companion app while playing. While an importer would work just as well, it requires more steps: open the SoT website profile page, run the script, 
        go back to the tracker and refresh. By using the "rat" token instead, a single click on the "refresh" button here is enough to refresh everything, which is far more convenient - even though it must be updated every week or so.</p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>Let me see the code!</h2><p><p>Sure. You can find it on the website's footer at any time, or here: <a href="https://github.com/Hyrull/SoT-Tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frontend code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Hyrull/SoT-Tracker-backend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backend code</a>.</p></p></div><div class="home-question"><h2>I have feedback / more questions.</h2><p>For bug reports, either send an issue on the repos above, or ping me on any Sea of Thieves Discord server I'm on (I'm on most). I'm @hyrul. Feel free to DM anything question or suggestion too.</p></div></div></div><footer><p>Website made by Hyrul &amp; Freya</p><div class="code-link"><a href="https://github.com/Hyrull/SoT-Tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source code</a><img alt="External link" class="external-link-icon" src="/assets/img/icons/external_link.svg"></div></footer></div>
